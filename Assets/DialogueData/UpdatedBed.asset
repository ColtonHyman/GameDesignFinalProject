  dialogue:
  - This is my bed. There is a deep divet in the shape of my sleeping body. It makes
    it really uncomfortable at night.
  - Granted, sleep doesn't come to me easily anyway. Even if I had the motivation
    to buy a new mattress...
  - I doubt it would do me any good. Still, for all that I complain about it, it's
    still my favorite place to be.
  - I certainly like it more than the outside world, at least.
