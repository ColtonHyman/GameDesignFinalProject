  dialogue:
  - I don't want to do this.
  - I really don't want to do this.
  - ...I have to do this. I know I don't want to. But I have to.
  - I can't keep living like this. Wallowing in pity, watching my life pass by me...
  - Losing motivation to do anything. To fix my things. To clean. To do the things
    I used to love.
  - ...This isn't something that I will be able to fix right away. In fact, it will
    probably take years.
  - But I can't expect my life to change if I don't take the first step.
  - ...So.
